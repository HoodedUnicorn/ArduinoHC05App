# ArduinoHC05App README
<h2> What will it do? </h2>
It is used for connecting via Bluetooth to a HC-05 module that is connected via Arduino, Turning the LED connected on and off. <br>
Or at least that is what I want it to do, Now let see if it can actually do that.

<h2> Project </h2>
 > Make an app that can connect to the HC05 via Bluetooth. <br>
 > Make it so that it can send data to the HC05 to turn LED on or off.

<h2> NPM Packages </h2>
 
 While there's a package on npm, I don't know how it got there.<br> It was an early release that contained some files that shouldn't be there (sensitive wise). It has since been deprecated. <br>
 In the future I hope that I can manage to get it to upload to the npm registry, but I get a load of errors.
 

<h2> Future Concepts </h2>

 >Make it work via WearOS
